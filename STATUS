With this artifact submission, we apply for the badges 
    * "Reusable" 
    * and "Available".

Our artifact provides both data and software. The data can
be used to reproduce our results. The software provides
a framework for testing Scratch programs automatically that 
are written in the Scratch programming language, which is
a central contribution of our work---reviewers even asked
for making the implementation of this framework available.
